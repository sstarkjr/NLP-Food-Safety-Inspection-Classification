    "# Summary\n",
    "I decided to perform a multi-class classification analysis.  I narrowed my dataset to pass, fail, or pass w/ conditions due to the sufficiency of data. It appears the logistic regression had the best performance of the three models I demonstrated above. The original logisitc regression actually performed better than the one I attempted to optimize. It had a test accuracy of 92%.  The model showed slight signs of overfitting as train accuracy was 96%. Precision and recall for test were 92% for each. Precision was 96% for class 0 (pass), 87% for class 1 (fail) and 86% for class 2 (pass w/ conditions). Furthermore we know f-1 scores are the weighted averaged of precision and recall. F1 scores of 98%, 86%, and 85%, for the same classes listed previously. The model clearly is able to accuractely identify pass recommendations but struggles a little more with fail and pass with conditions, which makes sense intuitively. the F1 scores show slightly more signs of overfitting so I would attempt to adjust that in my parameter tuning. This is out of scope for this analysis, but perhaps I would do some sort of grid search or random search to approximate better parameter values.\n",
    "* **Pre-processing** For text pre-processing, I decided that we needed to remove stopwords for this analysis. They are noise and do not contribute to the signal of the prediction. I also removed all the digits as again I believe they were more of a distraction. Also, within CountVectorizer, I included parameters to lowercase all words an\n",
    "* **Train/Test Split** I noticed a considerable class imbalance in the dataset between the three values. I made sure to stratify my sampling in train test split to ensure the train samples and test samples resembled the population of the dataset. Another thing I considered doing but did not as it was out of scope for this analysis was training my model on an equal split data using an under-sampling or oversampling approach. This would give the model a fair chance to fully train each class equally as opposed to seeing more data of the dominate class.\n"
